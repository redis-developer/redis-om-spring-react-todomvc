= TodoMVC: React w/ Hooks with a https://www.todobackend.com[Todo-Backend] API • http://todomvc.com[TodoMVC]

TodoMVC - is a project which offers the same Todo application implemented using MV* concepts
in most of the popular JavaScript MV* frameworks of today. At http://todomvc.com/ you'll find
several implementations of the same application using many of the existing SPA/JavaScript Frameworks.

This implementation is built with React 17+ using React Hooks and purely functional components with the only non-core runtime dependencies being https://reactrouter.com[React Router] and https://github.com/kabirbaidhya/keycode-js[keycode-js]. The application state is maintained by a backend API built following the specifications outlined at https://www.todobackend.com[Todo-Backend] and implemented using https://spring.io/projects/spring-boot[Spring Boot] and https://redis.io[Redis].

Read the top level https://github.com/redis-java/tut-spring-data-redis-react-todomvc/blob/main/README.asc[README]. for more information on the
https://www.todobackend.com[Todo-Backend] implementation using Redis + Spring Boot and Spring Boot Data Redis.

React is a JavaScript library for building user interfaces. It provides
simple to design declarative views. Composable, encapsulated components
that manage their own state.

== Implementation

* The app is built with https://reactjs.org/docs/introducing-jsx.html[JSX]. As stated in the link, JSX is not mandatory.
* I've divided the UI into 5 React components:
  - `TodoList`: Container responsible for displaying the list of `Todo` components. Provides controls for toggling the completed state of the Todos in the list.
  - `Todo`: Component that displays an individual Todo item and provides an interface to edit, delete and mark a Todo as completed.
  - `TodoListControls`: Control components that provides the functions to filter the list of todos, clear all completed Todos and display the number of items left.
  - `TodoForm`: Component that encapsulates the input field to create a new Todo.
  - `Footer`: A display-only component providing information.
* I use the https://reactjs.org/docs/hooks-reference.html#usecontext[React Context API] for state management in conjunction with a reducer (https://reactjs.org/docs/hooks-reference.html#usereducer[useReducer]) and a https://reactjs.org/docs/context.html#contextprovider[ContextProvider] that exposes an API to keep local changes synchronized with the REST API.
* Access to the backend API is accomplished using the Javascript https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Fetch_API[Fetch API]

== Running

This app is embedded as a webapp in a Spring Boot Application, to launch it
see the top level README.
