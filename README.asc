= Redis OM Spring + React • https://www.todobackend.com[Todo-Backend]

This project's commits walk you through the process of using Redis OM Spring to
build a RESTful API that satisfies the simple web API spec set by the https://www.todobackend.com[Todo-Backend] project
using JSON Documents stored in Redis.

____
The Todo-Backend project defines a simple web API spec - for managing a todo list. Contributors https://www.todobackend.com/contribute.html[implement] that spec using various tech stacks. A https://www.todobackend.com/specs/index.html[spec runner] verifies that each contribution implements the exact same API, by running an automated test suite which https://github.com/TodoBackend/todo-backend-js-spec/blob/master/js/specs.js[defines] the API.

The Todo-Backend project was inspired by the http://todomvc.com/[TodoMVC project].

== Cloning the project

This project includes a server-side spec runner https://github.com/TodoBackend/todo-backend-js-spec[todo-backend-js-spec] as a git submodule. To check out the project use the following git command to ensure the submodule is cloned along with the main repository:

====
[source,bash]
----
git clone git@github.com:redis-java/tut-spring-data-redis-react-todomvc.git --recurse-submodules
----
====

== What You Will build

You will build an application that uses Redis JSON document and the `@Document`
annotation to provide a https://redis.io[Redis]-powered data layer for a Spring Boot API backend that satisfies the contract set out by the Todo-Backend project.

For the UI you will then craft a pure JS webapp following the specifications set by the http://todomvc.com/[TodoMVC project] and using the https://reactjs.org[React] JavaScript library for building user interfaces. The webapp can be found under
the `src/main/webapp` and it provides it's own https://github.com/redis-java/tut-spring-data-redis-react-todomvc/blob/main/src/main/webapp/README.asc[README].

== What You Need

* Java 11 or higher (http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/index.html[JDK Java SE 11] or later)
* http://maven.apache.org/download.cgi[Maven 3.2+]
* You can also import the code straight into your IDE:
** https://spring.io/guides/gs/sts[Spring Tool Suite (STS)]
** https://spring.io/guides/gs/intellij-idea/[IntelliJ IDEA]
* Spring Boot 2.6.6 (included by Redis OM Spring)
* A https://redis.io[Redis] database with the https://redisearch.io[RediSearch] module version TODO or higher installed.  We've provided a `docker-compose.yml` with Redis Stack for this. You can also https://redis.com/try-free/[sign up for a free 30Mb database with Redis Enterprise Cloud] - be sure to check the box to configure a Redis Stack instance, follow https://developer.redis.com/create/rediscloud/[this guide].
* Optional: https://redis.com/redis-enterprise/redis-insight/[RedisInsight], a free data visualization and database management tool for Redis.  When downloading RedisInsight, be sure to select version 2.x.

== Setting up a Redis Stack Instance

Before you can build the TodoBackend API, you need to set up the Redis Stack instance that will host our data.
The server is freely available at https://redis.io/download.

There are many ways to get going with Redis but by far the three easiest are:

=== 🥞Redis Stack on Docker Locally

Redis OM Spring relies on the power of the [RediSearch][redisearch-url] and [RedisJSON][redis-json-url] modules.
We have provided a docker compose YAML file for you to quickly get started. To launch the docker compose application, on the command line (or via Docker Desktop), clone this repository and run (from the root folder):

====
[source,bash]
----
docker compose up
----
====

This launches Redis Stack; Redis Stack Server on port 6379, and Redis Insight 8001.

=== 🌥️Redis Cloud

If you're using Redis Enterprise Cloud, you'll need the hostname, port number, and password for your database.  Use these to set the `application.properties` configuration like this:

====
[source,bash]
----
spring.redis.host=<host>
spring.redis.port=<port>
spring.redis.password=<password>
----
====

For example if your Redis Enterprise Cloud database is at port `9139` on host `enterprise.redis.com` and your password is `5uper53cret` then you'd set `REDIS_OM_URL` as follows:

====
[source,bash]
----
spring.redis.host=enterprise.redis.com
spring.redis.port=9139
spring.redis.password=5uper53cret
----
====

== Spring Boot Skeleton

The app starting skeleton was created using the https://start.spring.io[Spring Initializr].

== API Controller

The main API controller can be found at `src/main/java/com/redislabs/edu/todo/controllers/TodosController.java`.

== Entry point into the React App

We provide a Spring MVC controller that serves the HTML template hosting the React App. This controller can be found at `src/main/java/com/redislabs/edu/todo/controllers/WebAppController.java`.

.src/main/java/com/redislabs/edu/todo/controllers/WebAppController.java
====
[source,java,highlight=1,3,5]
----
@Controller
public class WebAppController {
    @GetMapping
    public String index() {
        return "index";
    }
}
----

<1> `@Controller` marks this class as a Spring MVC controller.
<2> `@GetMapping` flags the `index()` method to serve GET request on the `/` route.
<3> It returns `index` as the name of the template, which Spring Boot's autoconfigured view resolver will map to `src/main/resources/templates/index.html`.
====

Learn more about the React App in its https://github.com/redis-developer/tut-spring-data-redis-react-todomvc/blob/main/src/main/webapp/README.asc[README].

== Building and Launching the Application

You can now launch the app either by running the `main()` method of `com.redislabs.edu.todo.TodoApplication` inside your IDE or by typing `./mvnw spring-boot:run` on the command line. (`mvnw.bat` for Windows users).

The output should show both the webapp (React) being bundled and the server-side (Spring Boot.. duh):

== Play with the App

The Server-Side Endpoint is found at `http://localhost:8080/todos` and the
React webapp is mounted at the root at `http://localhost:8080`. The Database is
preloaded with a few Beatles related Todos. Enjoy!

We've also embedded the server-side spec runner as a git submodule. To launch it, simply open the following HTML file on your browser (Mac open command shown below):

====
[source,bash]
----
open ./js-spec/index.html
----
====

In the input field shown enter `http://localhost:8080/todos` and press return. The spec runner will execute the specs, if everything is working correctly you should see the all the server-side specifications passing.

== 🧭Interact with the API

You can interact with the API directly with CURL or through the http://localhost:8080/swagger-ui/[Swagger interface].
